# cantdecide
Idea for an app that helps you make decisions

## Goals

- Be like Paper, only more flexible
- Be useful for as many decisions as possible
- Do not distract: minimal visuals for focus on the content
- Keep a permanent history to go back to

## Anti-Goals

- Multi-User
- Server-side saving

## Approach
### Tech

- Implement as a responsive web app
- Use elm: Ideal for reactive apps, superb refactoring, events are easily put in a history
- Be interoperable with markdown: easy editing, useful even without ui

### UI
